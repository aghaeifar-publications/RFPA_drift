abstract = {Purpose The PLANET method was designed to simultaneously reconstruct maps of T1 and T2, the off-resonance, the RF phase, and the banding free signal magnitude. The method requires a stationary B0 field over the course of a phase-cycled balanced SSFP acquisition. In this work we investigated the influence of B0 drift on the performance of the PLANET method for single-component and two-component signal models, and we propose a strategy for drift correction. Methods The complex phase-cycled balanced SSFP signal was modeled with and without frequency drift. The behavior of the signal influenced by drift was mathematically interpreted as a sum of drift-dependent displacement of the data points along an ellipse and drift-dependent rotation around the origin. The influence of drift on parameter estimates was investigated experimentally on a phantom and on the brain of healthy volunteers and was verified by numerical simulations. A drift correction algorithm was proposed and tested on a phantom and in vivo. Results Drift can be assumed to be linear over the typical duration of a PLANET acquisition. In a phantom (a single-component signal model), drift induced errors of 4\% and 8\% in the estimated T1 and T2 values. In the brain, where multiple components are present, drift only had a minor effect. For both single-component and two-component signal models, drift-induced errors were successfully corrected by applying the proposed drift correction algorithm. Conclusion We have demonstrated theoretically and experimentally the sensitivity of the PLANET method to B0 drift and have proposed a drift correction method.},

abstract = {Magnetization Transfer Contrast (MTC) and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) experiments measure the transfer of magnetization from molecular protons to the solvent water protons, an effect that becomes apparent as an MRI signal loss (“saturation”). This allows molecular information to be accessed with the enhanced sensitivity of MRI. In analogy to Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), these saturation data are presented as a function of the chemical shift of participating proton groups, e.g. OH, NH, NH2, which is called a Z-spectrum. In tissue, these Z-spectra contain the convolution of multiple saturation transfer effects, including nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) and chemical exchange contributions from protons in semi-solid and mobile macromolecules or tissue metabolites. As a consequence, their appearance depends on the magnetic field strength (B0) and pulse sequence parameters such as B1 strength, pulse shape and length, and interpulse delay, which presents a major problem for quantification and reproducibility of MTC and CEST effects. The use of higher B0 can bring several advantages. In addition to higher detection sensitivity (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR), both MTC and CEST studies benefit from longer water T1 allowing the saturation transferred to water to be retained longer. While MTC studies are non-specific at any field strength, CEST specificity is expected to increase at higher field because of a larger chemical shift dispersion of the resonances of interest (similar to MRS). In addition, shifting to a slower exchange regime at higher B0 facilitates improved detection of the guanidinium protons of creatine and the inherently broad resonances of the amine protons in glutamate and the hydroxyl protons in myoinositol, glycogen, and glucosaminoglycans. Finally, due to the higher mobility of the contributing protons in CEST versus MTC, many new pulse sequences can be designed to more specifically edit for CEST signals and to remove MTC contributions.}

abstract = {Purpose The goal of this study is to characterize and improve the accuracy of 2D magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) scans in the presence of slice profile (SP) and B1 imperfections, which are two main factors that affect quantitative results in MRF. Methods The SP and B1 imperfections are characterized and corrected separately. The SP effect is corrected by simulating the radiofrequency pulse in the dictionary, and the B1 is corrected by acquiring a B1 map using the Bloch-Siegert method before each scan. The accuracy, precision, and repeatability of the proposed method are evaluated in phantom studies. The effects of both SP and B1 imperfections are also illustrated and corrected in the in vivo studies. Results The SP and B1 corrections improve the accuracy of the T1 and T2 values, independent of the shape of the radiofrequency pulse. The T1 and T2 values obtained from different excitation patterns become more consistent after corrections, which leads to an improvement of the robustness of the MRF design. Conclusion This study demonstrates that MRF is sensitive to both SP and B1 effects, and that corrections can be made to improve the accuracy of MRF with only a 2-s increase in acquisition time.

abstract = {Abstract Purpose To investigate an alternative approach to correct for flip angle inaccuracies in the driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) T1 mapping method. Materials and Methods While DESPOT1 is a robust method for rapid whole-brain voxelwise mapping of the longitudinal relaxation time, the approach is inherently sensitive to inaccuracies in the transmitted flip angle, defined by the B1 field, which become more severe with increased field. Here we propose an extension of the DESPOT1 technique, involving the additional acquisition of an inversion-prepared SPGR image alongside the conventional multiangle DESPOT1 data. From these combined data both B1 and T1 may be determined with high accuracy and precision. The method is evaluated at 3T with phantom and in vivo imaging experiments, with derived T1 estimates compared with values calculated from multiple inversion time inversion recovery data. Results The method provides robust correction of flip angle variations, with less than 5\% error compared with reference values for T1 between 300 msec and 2500 msec. Conclusions The described approach, dubbed DESPOT1-HIFI, permits whole-brain T1 mapping at 3T, with 1 mm3 isotropic voxels, in a clinically feasible time (≈10 minutes) with T1 accuracy greater than 5\% and with high precision.

abstract = {Purpose Triple echo steady state (TESS) uses the lowest steady state configuration modes for rapid relaxometry. Due to its unbalanced gradient scheme, however, TESS is inherently motion-sensitive. The purpose of this work is to merge TESS with a balanced acquisition scheme for motion-insensitive rapid configuration relaxometry, termed MIRACLE. Methods The lowest order steady state free precession (SSFP) configurations are retrieved by Fourier transformation of the frequency response of N frequency-shifted balanced SSFP (bSSFP) scans and subsequently processed for relaxometry, as proposed with TESS. Accuracy of MIRACLE is evaluated from simulations, phantom studies as well as in vivo brain and cartilage imaging at 3T. Results Simulations and phantom results revealed no conceptual flaw, and artifact-free configuration imaging was achieved in vivo. Overall, relaxometry results were accurate in phantoms and in good agreement for cartilage and for in the brain, but apparent low values were observed for brain white matter; reflecting asymmetries in the bSSFP profile. Conclusion Rapid and mapping with MIRACLE offers analogous properties as TESS while successfully mitigating its motion-sensitivity. As a result of the Fourier transformation, relaxometry becomes sensitive to the voxel frequency distribution, which may contain useful physiologic information, such as structural brain integrity. © 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

abstract = {Purpose To demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, ellipse fitting approach, named PLANET, for simultaneous estimation of relaxation times T1 and T2 from a single 3D phase-cycled balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequence. Methods A method is presented in which the elliptical signal model is used to describe the phase-cycled bSSFP steady-state signal. The fitting of the model to the acquired data is reformulated into a linear convex problem, which is solved directly by a linear least squares method, specific to ellipses. Subsequently, the relaxation times T1 and T2, the banding free magnitude, and the off-resonance are calculated from the fitting results. Results Maps of T1 and T2, as well as an off-resonance and a banding free magnitude can be simultaneously, quickly, and robustly estimated from a single 3D phase-cycled bSSFP sequence. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated in a phantom and in the brain of healthy volunteers on a clinical MR scanner. The results were in good agreement for the phantom, but a systematic underestimation of T1 was observed in the brain. Conclusion The presented method allows for accurate mapping of relaxation times and off-resonance, and for the reconstruction of banding free magnitude images at realistic signal-to-noise ratios.

abstract = {Purpose Rapid imaging techniques have attracted increased interest for relaxometry, but none are perfect: they are prone to static (B0) and transmit (B1) field heterogeneities, and commonly biased by T2/T1. The purpose of this study is the development of a rapid T1 and T2 relaxometry method that is completely (T2) or partly (T1) bias-free. Methods A new method is introduced to simultaneously quantify T1 and T2 within one single scan based on a triple echo steady-state (TESS) approach in combination with an iterative golden section search. TESS relaxometry is optimized and evaluated from simulations, in vitro studies, and in vivo experiments. Results It is found that relaxometry with TESS is not biased by T2/T1, insensitive to B0 heterogeneities, and, surprisingly, that TESS-T2 is not affected by B1 field errors. Consequently, excellent correspondence between TESS and reference spin echo data is observed for T2 in vitro at 1.5 T and in vivo at 3 T. Conclusion TESS offers rapid T1 and T2 quantification within one single scan, and in particular B1-insensitive T2 estimation. As a result, the new proposed method is of high interest for fast and reliable high-resolution T2 mapping, especially of the musculoskeletal system at high to ultra-high fields.

abstract = {Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based on a two-steps approach: estimation of the magnetic moments distribution inside the body, followed by a voxel-by-voxel quantification of the human tissue properties. This splitting simplifies the computations but poses several constraints on the measurement process, limiting its efficiency. Here, we perform quantitative MRI as a one step process; signal localization and parameter quantification are simultaneously obtained by the solution of a large scale nonlinear inversion problem based on first-principles. As a consequence, the constraints on the measurement process can be relaxed and acquisition schemes that are time efficient and widely available in clinical MRI scanners can be employed. We show that the nonlinear tomography approach is applicable to MRI and returns human tissue maps from very short experiments.}

abstract = {Purpose It is shown that the steady state of rapid, TR-periodic steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequences at small to moderate flip angles exhibits a universal, approximate scaling law with respect to variations of B1+\$\$ {B}\_1^{+} \$\$. Implications for the accuracy and precision of relaxometry experiments are discussed. Methods The approximate scaling law is derived from and numerically tested against known analytical solutions. To assess the attainable estimator precision in a typical relaxometry experiment, we calculate the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) and perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Results The approximate universal scaling holds well up to moderate flip angles. For pure steady state relaxometry, we observe a significant precision penalty for simultaneous estimation of R1\$\$ {R}\_1 \$\$ and B1+\$\$ {B}\_1^{+} \$\$, whereas good R2\$\$ {R}\_2 \$\$ estimates can be obtained without even knowing the correct actual flip angle. Conclusion Simultaneous estimation of R1\$\$ {R}\_1 \$\$ and B1+\$\$ {B}\_1^{+} \$\$ from a set of SSFP steady states alone is not advisable. Apart from separate B1+\$\$ {B}\_1^{+} \$\$ measurements, the problem can be addressed by adding transient state information, but, depending on the situation, residual effects due to the scaling may still require some attention.},
